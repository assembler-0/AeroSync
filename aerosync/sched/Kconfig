config SCHED_SMT
    bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
    default y
    help
      Improve the scheduler's decision making when dealing with SMT (Simultaneous
      Multi-Threading) siblings. This ensures that the scheduler avoids
      scheduling multiple tasks on the same physical core if other cores are
      completely idle.

config SCHED_MC
    bool "Multi-core scheduler support"
    default y
    help
      Enable Multi-core (MC) domain scheduling. This helps the scheduler
      understand cache sharing (LLC) between cores, allowing for better
      locality-aware task placement.

config SCHED_HYBRID
    bool "Hybrid (P/E core) scheduler support"
    default y
    help
      Enable support for Intel Hybrid architectures (e.g. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake).
      The scheduler will distinguish between Performance (P) cores and Efficiency (E)
      cores, preferring P-cores for compute-intensive tasks and E-cores for
      background tasks.

config SCHED_AUTOGROUP
    bool "Automatic process group scheduling"
    default y
    help
      This option optimizes the scheduler for desktop workloads by grouping
      tasks by session and ensuring that each session gets a fair share of
      CPU time, regardless of how many threads it contains.
