config VFS
    bool "Virtual File System (VFS) support"
    default y
    help
      Enable support for the Virtual File System layer.

config DEVFS
    bool "Device Filesystem (devfs) support"
    depends on VFS
    default y
    help
      Enable support for devfs, a pseudo-filesystem for device nodes.
      This provides a mechanism for drivers to register themselves
      and expose nodes to userspace.

config DEVFS_MOUNT
    bool "Mount devfs automatically during boot"
    depends on DEVFS
    default y
    help
      Automatically mount devfs during kernel initialization.
      Note: This is generally considered a policy decision and
      should be handled by userspace unless early kernel access
      to device nodes is required.

config DEVFS_MOUNT_PATH
    string "Default mount path for devfs"
    depends on DEVFS_MOUNT
    default "/runtime/devices"
    help
      The path where devfs should be mounted automatically.

config USTARFS
    bool "USTAR (tar) filesystem support"
    depends on VFS
    default y
    help
      Enable support for the USTAR filesystem, useful for initrd.
